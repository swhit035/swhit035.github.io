        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying criminal justice with a minor in psychology. I am planning on working for the CLD next semester.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy taking long walks around campus and watching the different sports that goes on. I like to play for my society and have taken a liking to softball because of it. I go to Hampton Park Baptist and plan to become a member in a couple weeks so i can volunteer for nursery and orchestra.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy reading and being with my family.
